  "description": "Model output for ScenarioMIP SSP1-26 experiment using UKESM1 described in Sellar et al.,2019, DOI:10.1029/2019MS001739).  The simulation follows the experimental design of the CMIP6 ScenarioMIP SSP1-26 experiment. This simulation spans 2015-2100, with emissions taken from 
Gidden et al.  DOI::10.5194/gmd2018-266),  The data comprise monthly mean output over the period 1979-2010 for ozone, ozone production and loss, and diagnostics suitable for the calculation of the tropospheric ozone budget.  We archive data from this experiment as HIST, and iIn order to assess the role of recent changes to the stratospheric ozone burden on the tropospheric ozone budget, a second integration (fODS_LBC) is archived  in which the lower boundary condition of all halogenated ODS was kept constant at 1979 values, but all other forcings and emissions were allowed to evolve as in the HIST experiment",
